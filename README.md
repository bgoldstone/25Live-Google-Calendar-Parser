# 25Live-Google-Calendar-Parser
Self-directed project in which I created a Google App Script that ported the calendar information from 25Live Pro to a Google Calendar format. This project was completed using Google App Script, JSON, the JavaScript fetch API, Google Calendar API, and Regular Expressions for ical file parsing.
